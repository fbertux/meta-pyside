DESCRIPTION = "GeneratorRunner is a tool that eases the development of binding generators for C++ and Qt-based libraries by \
providing a framework to help automating most of the process. It uses the ApiExtractor library to parse the header files and \
manipulate the classes information while generating the binding code using front-end modules provided by the user."
